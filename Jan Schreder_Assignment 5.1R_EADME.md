Problem Statement:
The dataframe aims to analyze coupon usage across various restaurants. Detailed descriptions follow below.

High-Level Overview of Findings:
For more detailed insights, refer to the Jupyter Notebook.

Initial Data Analysis:
The data were first scrutinized to identify missing or problematic entries.

Analysis of Bar Coupons:
Key findings include:

Individuals visiting bars more than 3 times per month are likely to accept coupons.
This trend also holds for those over 25 who visit at least once monthly.
Conversely, those visiting bars less than 3 times per month tend to decline coupons.
Drivers with child passengers show minimal inclination to accept coupons.
Analysis of Coffee House Coupons:
Notable observations include:

Both genders utilize coupons similarly.
Wealthier individuals marginally accept coffee house coupons less than their less wealthy counterparts.
Weather conditions significantly affect coupon acceptance; rainy or snowy weather decreases acceptance rates.
Preference for coffee early in the morning (7am) versus later (10am) shows no substantial difference.

Detailled description:
Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaraunt near where you are driving. 
Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaraunt? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a sunbsequent trip? 
Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaraunt? What about a coffee house? 
Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? 
Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?
Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, 
but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?
